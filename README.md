# Titanic Survival Analysis Project

## 📊 Project Overview
This project explores the Titanic disaster dataset to uncover patterns and factors influencing passenger survival rates using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The analysis covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and insights from visualizations.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **Titanic-analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with the full analysis, including data preprocessing, EDA, and visualizations.
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python libraries needed for the analysis.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis and visualization

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values and format data
- **EDA:** Identify trends related to survival rates (e.g., by gender, class, and age)
- **Feature Engineering:** Create new insights from existing data (e.g., family size)
- **Visualizations:** Use charts to present key findings
- **Insights:** Analyze patterns and survival probabilities

## 📈 Results and Insights
- **Key Trends:** Higher survival rates for women and children, and lower rates for third-class passengers.
- **Patterns:** Correlation between survival and passenger class, family size, and embarkation port.
- **Insights:** First-class passengers and females had a significant survival advantage.
